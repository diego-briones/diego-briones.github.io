I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia. I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in labor economics, public economics, economics of education, and household finance. My current research largely focuses on the economic consequences of government education financing programs, with a particular emphasis on student debt and consumer credit markets.

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">
     Student loan forgiveness has featured prominently in the political debate around policy
 responses to address rising debt burdens, yet there is strikingly little evidence of its
 electoral implications. We study the consequences of the 2022 broad-based debt relief
 program implemented by the Biden administration less than a month before the November midterm elections. Using geographic information on over 25 million applications
 for cancellation benefits, we document the program’s influence on congressional races.
 Counties where a higher share of the voting-age population submitted applications
 had higher vote shares for Democratic party candidates. Program exposure does not
 significantly predict Democratic voting in prior elections, and individual-level survey
 data provide corroborating evidence for our county-level estimates. Our results provide
 evidence for the role of wealth-targeting policies in shaping voter behavior even when
 the benefits are not realized.

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">
    Beginning in March 2020 and ultimately continuing to September 2023, most student
 loan borrowers had their required payments on federal student loans paused. For student
 loan borrowers with limited access to credit, the payment pause provided additional
 cash-on-hand that may have allowed them to reduce their work hours. Using survey data
 capturing individual finances, monthly work characteristics and educational attainment,
 we find that suspended student debt payments reduced average weekly hours worked
 by 1.34 (-4%) over a 10-month period with declines concentrated among workers who
 had not completed a college degree. For borrowers who had completed a college degree
 or graduate degree, there is no evidence that the payment pause changed employment
 or hours worked. These findings are consistent with consumer finance data showing
 that borrower households without a college degree are approximately twice as likely to
 report liquidity constraints relative to more educated households with federal student
 debt.

	<summary> Abstract</summary>
    <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 10px;">
    For workers employed in the public and nonprofit sectors, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers the potential for full forgiveness of federal student loans for those with 10 years of full-time work experience. A year-long waiver issued by the Department of Education in 2021 to address administrative problems in program access provided a new path to PSLF relief for many borrowers. We explore the overall impact and distributional implications of potential full participation in loan forgiveness enabled by the PSLF waiver program using the 2018 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Our estimates identify more than $100 billion in loan forgiveness available to as many as 3.45 million borrowers through the PSLF waiver program. Potential beneficiaries of this initiative are disproportionately employed in occupations like teaching and health care. Full take-up of the PSLF waiver would lead to a narrowing of the racial gap in student debt burden. However, the distributional impact of the PSLF waiver depends critically on the take-up rate and there is some evidence that those borrowers with relatively high income or advanced degrees have been most likely to access benefits.
